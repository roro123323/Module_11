# Background
Now, you're well-equipped to embark on a comprehensive web-scraping and data analysis project. You've acquired the skills to identify HTML elements within web pages, pinpoint their id and class attributes, and effectively extract data using both automated browsing via Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. Your knowledge extends to scraping diverse types of information, from HTML tables to recurring elements such as multiple news articles on a webpage.

As you tackle this challenge, bear in mind that you're further honing your fundamental abilities: gathering data, structuring and storing data, conducting data analysis, and ultimately conveying your findings visually.
